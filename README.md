What is Generative AI?

Essentially, Generative AI makes use of a model (such as a "Large Language Model" like GPT4) that enables the AI to generate new content with little human interaction.  You should think of it as an automated paraphraser, albeit with some serious caveats.  AI professionals refer to Generative AI as "a stochastic parrot" or "a reality-starved paraphraser".  The AI doesn't know what it is saying (or whether what it says is real or not), but it says it very nicely.  Sometimes, the Generative AI can depart significantly from reality, and this is known as "going [hysterical](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/users-show-microsoft-bings-chatgpt-ai-going-off-the-deep-end)."  However, even with those limitations, Generative AI has met with great commercial success.  Since it is not tied to reality, marketing people love it.  

Beware, however, for lawyers have been sanctioned for using it unwisely.  See, *e.g.*, [Mata v. Avianca, Inc.](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.54.0_3.pdf) ("Peter LoDuca, Steven A. Schwartz and the law firm of Levidow, Levidow & Oberman P.C. (the "Levidow Firm") (collectively, "Respondents") abandoned their responsibilities when they submitted non-existent judicial opinions with fake quotes and citations created by the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, then continued to stand by the fake opinions after judicial orders called their existence into question.")

This was enough of a problem that some courts now have standing orders related to AI-generated material.  *See, e.g.*, a [order](http://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/_assets/_documents/_forms/_judges/Fuentes/Standing%20Order%20For%20Civil%20Cases%20Before%20Judge%20Fuentes%20rev'd%205-31-23.pdf) by Magistrate Judge Gabriel A. Fuentes (N.D. Ill.) that was adopted on May 31, 2023.
