What is Generative AI?

Essentially, Generative AI makes use of a model (such as a "Large Language Model" like GPT4) that enables the AI to generate new content with little human interaction.  You should think of it as an automated paraphraser, albeit with some serious caveats.  AI professionals refer to Generative AI as "a stochastic parrot" or "a reality-starved paraphraser".  The AI doesn't know what it is saying (or whether what it says is real or not), but it says it very nicely.  However, even with those limitations, Generative AI has met with great commercial success.
