# A Compendium of Artificial Intelligence (specifically for lawyers)
This compendium was produced for the 2023 Texas Advanced Business Law Conference.  This document is seen as far more useful than a traditional paper.  Moreover, this compendium may be updated in the future, in stark contrast to traditional papers.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
There is no one single definition of artificial intelligence.  Fortunately, there is a "classic" formulation of AI in the form of the following set of quotes, courtesy of AI pioneers Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig in their book "[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima/)" (4th ed., 2023):

### Thinking Humanly: The Cognitive Modeling Approach

`"The exciting new effort to make computers think ... machines with minds, in the full and literal sense." (Gaugeland, 1985)`

`"{The automation of} Activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving, learning..." (Bellman, 1978)`

### Thinking Rationally: The "Laws of Thought" Approach

`"The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models." (Charniak and McDermott, 1985)`

`"The sutdy of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act." (Winston, 1992)`

### Acting Humanly: The Turing Test Approach

`"The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people." (Kurzweil, 1990)`

`"The study of how to make coputers do things at which, at the moment, people are better." (Rich and Knight, 1991)`

### Acting Rationally: The Rational Agent Approach

`"Computational Intelligence is the stuy of the design of intelligent agents." (Poole et al., 1998)`

`AI ...is concerned with intelligent behavior in artificats." (Nilsson, 1998)`

You can find other definitions [here](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence), [here](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/what-is/artificial-intelligence.html), and [here](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence).

A few things to note.  All of those quotes were from the Twentieth Century.  AI was first conceived by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle).  Work on neural networks started in the 1950's.  What you see now is the culmination of decades of work by thousands of people.

## Types of AI

Some types (or combinations of types) of AI are famous.  Many types of AI labor in the background -- unseen and unnoticed -- some of which have significant legal implications.

The most important thing to remember is that there are many types of AI, as the chart below suggests:

![Types of AI](https://github.com/ronchi/ai_compendium/blob/main/ai_types.png)

We will address each type of AI, as well as link to various other sources, below.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is the aspect of AI that lawyers deal with most often -- both directly and indirectly.

#### Generative AI 
What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a subset of Natural Language Processing.  Specifically, Generative AI employs the *Answering Questions* and *Text Generation* aspects of NLP.  The *Answering Questions* aspect is the interface that is used to ask the question.  In recent parlance, the *Answering Questions* aspect is called a *Prompt*.  The answer that comes back is from the *Text Generation* machine.  A classic example of the Promt/Generation duo is [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt).

Essentially, Generative AI makes use of a model (such as a "Large Language Model" like GPT4) that enables the AI to generate new content with little human interaction.  You should think of it as an automated paraphraser, albeit with some serious caveats.  AI professionals refer to Generative AI as "a stochastic parrot" or "a reality-starved paraphraser".  The AI doesn't know what it is saying (or whether what it says is real or not), but it says it very nicely.  Sometimes, the Generative AI can depart significantly from reality, and this is known as "going [hysterical](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/users-show-microsoft-bings-chatgpt-ai-going-off-the-deep-end)."  However, even with those limitations, Generative AI has met with great commercial success.  Since Generative AI is not tied to reality, marketing people love it.  

Beware, however, for lawyers have been sanctioned for using it unwisely.  See, *e.g.*, [Mata v. Avianca, Inc.](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368/gov.uscourts.nysd.575368.54.0_3.pdf) ("Peter LoDuca, Steven A. Schwartz and the law firm of Levidow, Levidow & Oberman P.C. (the "Levidow Firm") (collectively, "Respondents") abandoned their responsibilities when they submitted non-existent judicial opinions with fake quotes and citations created by the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, then continued to stand by the fake opinions after judicial orders called their existence into question.")

Unwise reliance on Generative AI is enough of a problem that some courts now have standing orders related to AI-generated material.  *See, e.g.*, an [order](http://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/_assets/_documents/_forms/_judges/Fuentes/Standing%20Order%20For%20Civil%20Cases%20Before%20Judge%20Fuentes%20rev'd%205-31-23.pdf) by Magistrate Judge Gabriel A. Fuentes (N.D. Ill.) that was adopted on May 31, 2023.

Having said all of this, you should know that you can "fine tune" your own AI on something real.  In other words, you can direct the AI to look at a corpus of documents (e.g., opinions from the Texas Supreme Court, or [ESI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronically_stored_information_(Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure)) from a witness) and let it answer questions -- and identify the document(s) from which it drew to answer your question.

Here is a set of articles that discuss Generative AI in depth.

- [The Generative AI Revolution: Key Legal Considerations for the Consumer Products Industry](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/generative-ai-revolution-key-legal-considerations-consumer-products-industry) (This article discusses the important legal aspects of generative AI systems such as [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Microsoft's Copilot](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/), and similar commercial offerings.)
